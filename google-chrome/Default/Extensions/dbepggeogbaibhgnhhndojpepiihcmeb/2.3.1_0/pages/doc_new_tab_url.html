    <p>
      When using Vimium, there are two ways to open new tabs:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Browser commands (like Cmd-T or Ctrl-T)</li>
    <li>Vimium's "create new tab" command (mapped to <code>t</code> by default)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When using browser commands to open new tabs, Vimium commands and keybindings will not work on
      those new tab pages. This means one can't open the Vomnibar or use any other Vimium commands
      until navigating to a different website.
    </p>

    <p>
      To resolve this, the Vimium new tab page extension can be installed. It's meant to be used in
      tandem with Vimium. This extension replaces all new tab pages opened by the browser with
      Vimium's new tab page.
